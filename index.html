      <p>
        My name is Mims. I am passionate about fitness. <br />
        <br />
        I have created this page to share my fitness journey to inspire someone.
        My love for fitness started about 10 years ago, with breaks here and
        there to attend to motherhood ðŸ˜Š, and sometimes due to backtracking. The
        most important thing is to get up and get back on track. For the past 2
        years I have remained consistent and I am happy with my progress. The
        key is to know that you are in competition with only yourself. Fitness
        is not an even, <em> it's a lifestyle!</em> Small, consistent effort
        everyday will yield results in the long term. The focus should be on
        enjoying the process, and results will eventually show. For me, fitness
        is more than just physical, it soothes my mind, my soul. I will put on a
        playlist of my favourite songs for a workout and I promise you, it is
        therapeutic.
        <br />
        In my next posts I will be sharing my daily workout routines. Stay
        tuned!!
